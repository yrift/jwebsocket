jWebSocket_Test_Bundle.js is automatically generated by the deployment scripts. 
If you are actively working on tests, just include your test normally on the runTests.htm, but 
once you are done with the testing, please remove that link from the web page and add this 
test to the bundle by running the deployment script "1.1_createJSDocs.bat" from the 
deployment folder, by manually copying the test within the jWebSocket_Test_Bundle.js file
or by running the following command on windows command line:
copy /b jwsAutomatedAPITests.js + jwsBenchmarks.js + jwsChannelTests.js + jwsFilesystemTests.js + jwsIOC.js + jwsItemStorageTests.js + jwsJDBCTests.js + jwsJMSTests.js + jwsLoadBalancerTests.js + jwsLoadTests.js + jwsLoggingTests.js + jwsQuotaTests.js + jwsReportingTests.js + jwsREST.js + jwsRPCTests.js + jwsScriptingPlugInTest.js + jwsSharedTests.js + jwsStreamingTests.js + jwsSystemTests.js ..\jWebSocket_Test_Bundle.js

Once you are done updating the jWebSocket_Test_Bundle.js file, please upload it again to the jWebSocket Server SVN.

Note: Please if you update any of the tests don't forget to update the bundle 
as well, otherwise you will not see the changes in the webpage.
